# [Student Records](https://jiannejose.github.io/student_records/)

### Simple JavaScript Practice

I practiced the concept of MVVM that I have learned during the development of my latest version of To-Do List. 

My codes here are not in DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) approach yet. I'll have another version of my Student Records with better codes in it. ^__^

Please note that I am focusing on JavaScript practice at the moment so bare with my css. :)
